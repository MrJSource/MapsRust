You can write on any questions, in my discord, but do not forget to tag "lone.design" in the discord so that I can see what you want to write to me.

If there is in the archive! The BetterNpc folder can only be installed if you have purchased this plugin. 
NPCs are configured and installed on all Monuments, thematic NPCs for the map are configured and installed on custom monuments.
If you do not have the plugin, but want to purchase it, then you can do it at the link: https://lone.design/product/betternpc/

If you notice small friezes on the map, then I recommend installing the plugin from the archive: NoRain.cs
This plugin removes rain and storms, thereby friezes disappear in locations with a large number of stones

How do I host this .map file i just purchased?
To utilize my .map files that are included in all map downloads simply upload the map to a domain where clients who connect to your server can download it. I personally use DropBox or Github.
• Once the .map is uploaded to dropbox simply copy the share link attached to it.
• Once you've copied the link paste it into your server's startup .bat (batch) file. (Remove the worldsize/seed from your batch if it's in there)
• Example "levelurl "https:// www dropbox dot com/s/sdfagbragae/testmapname.map?dl=1"
• Make SURE the dl=0 at the end is changed to dl=1 otherwise players won't be able to join!
• Now just start your server and it'll boot right up! Below I'll attach a video that goes more in-depth on hosting custom maps vs proc gen maps since it's a tad different

How do I want all the electrics on the map to work?
• You need to install an add-on to the map: https://github.com/k1lly0u/Oxide.Ext.RustEdit
